# Meteotest Trial Day Challenge

The challenge was to plot the difference between two timeseries of rain values coming from two different sources: radar and measurement.

The task has been completed in a React environment created with the help of create-react-app and includes:

* data gathering making requests to an in-house service
* data preprocessing by interpolation of the time series to make them similar 
* plot the time series with a custom plot using D3.js

Here's a screeshot of the result:
